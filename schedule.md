For instance, forest inventory, a cornerstone of efficient and sustainable forestry, is still traditionally performed manually by qualified professionals.<details style="display:inline;"closed><summary>More</summary>The lack of automation in this particular task, consisting chiefly of measuring tree attributes, limits its speed, and, therefore, the area that can be economically covered. To this effect, we propose to use recent advancements in three‐dimensional mapping approaches in forests to automatically measure tree diameters from mobile robot observations. While previous studies showed the potential for such technology, they lacked a rigorous analysis of diameter estimation methods in challenging and large‐scale forest environments. Here, we validated multiple diameter estimation methods, including two novel ones, in a new publicly‐available dataset which includes four different forest sites, 11 trajectories, totaling 1458 tree observations, and 14,000 m2. From our extensive validation, we concluded that our mapping method is usable in the context of automated forest inventory, with our best diameter estimation method yielding a root mean square error of 3.45 cm for our whole dataset and 2.04 cm in ideal conditions consisting of mature forest with well‐spaced trees. Furthermore, we release this dataset to the public (https://norlab.ulaval.ca/research/montmorencydataset), to spur further research in robotic forest inventories. Finally, stemming from this large‐scale experiment, we provide recommendations for future deployments of mobile robots in a forestry context.</details></p></td>

The paper presents a novel Domain Adaptive shake-shake Residual neural Network approach (DARNet) to simultaneously address these challenges.<details style="display:inline;"closed><summary>More</summary>The proposed DARNet approach has the following characteristics. First, to efficiently capture the weak disease signature information from insufficient training samples, we build into DARNet a novel deep multi-branched residual neural network architecture with shake-shake regularization, where the multi-branched residual architecture is designed for efficient learning of the subtle disease signature, and the shake-shake regularization is designed to overcome the overfitting problem that usually happens in deep feature learning from insufficient dataset. Second, to efficiently learn disease signature information from both indoor and outdoor crop datasets, DARNet is designed to involve some rule-based domain mapping functions and transfer learning procedures to minimize the gaps between the two datasets and to enable transfer learning among two domains. The proposed DARNet is evaluated on two heterogeneous datasets produced from an indoor and an in-field environment respectively. DARNet is trained on both indoor and in-field corn disease datasets and tested on the in-field dataset. DARNet achieves a high test accuracy of 89.25%, demonstrating that the proposed machine learning approach can efficiently capture the subtle disease signature information from heterogeneous datasets with limited training samples and therefore is promising for developing hand-held camera-based crop disease recognition techniques.</details></p></td>

Objects in high enough altitudes do not re-enter and burn up in the atmosphere, but stay in orbit around Earth for a long time.<details style="display:inline;"closed><summary>More</summary>With a speed of 28,000 km/h, collisions in these orbits can generate fragments and potentially trigger a cascade of more collisions known as the Kessler syndrome. This could pose a planetary challenge, because the phenomenon could escalate to the point of hindering future space operations and damaging satellite infrastructure critical for space and Earth science applications. As commercial entities place mega-constellations of satellites in orbit, the burden on operators conducting collision avoidance manoeuvres will increase. For this reason, development of automated tools that predict potential collision events (conjunctions) is critical. We introduce a Bayesian deep learning approach to this problem, and develop recurrent neural network architectures (LSTMs) that work with time series of conjunction data messages (CDMs), a standard data format used by the space community. We show that our method can be used to model all CDM features simultaneously, including the time of arrival of future CDMs, providing predictions of conjunction event evolution with associated uncertainties.</details></p></td>

Then, building on edge-inference techniques for social networks (Hoskins et al. 2018), we develop an efficient first-order optimization method for solving the problem, which significantly outperforms existing techniques in experiments on synthetic and real genetic data.</details></p></td>

                      <td style="text-align:left"><p style="display:inline";>Soil degradation is an important environmental problem which affects the Alpine ecosystem and agriculture. Research results suggest that soil degradation in Swiss Alpine grasslands has increased in recent years and it is expected to increase further due to climate and land-use change.<details style="display:inline;"closed><summary>More</summary>However, reliably quantifying the increase in spatial extent of soil degradation is a challenging task. Although methods like Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) can provide precise detection of erosion sites, an efficient large scale investigation is not feasible due to the labour intensive nature and lack of transferability of the method. In this study, we overcome these limitations by adapting the fully convolutional neural network U-Net trained on high-quality training data provided by OBIA to enable efficient segmentation of erosion sites in high-resolution aerial images. We find that segmentation results of both methods, OBIA and U-Net, are generally in good agreement, but display method specific difference, with an overall precision of 73% and recall of 84%. Importantly, both methods indicate an increase in soil degradation for a case study region over a 16-year period of 167% and 201% for OBIA and U-Net, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the U-Net approach transfers well to new regions (within our study region) and data from subsequent years, even when trained on a comparably small training dataset. Thus the proposed approach enables large scale analysis in Swiss Alpine grasslands and provides a tool for reliable assessment of temporal changes in soil degradation.</details></p></td>

These are fed by smaller tributaries that make up much of the dendritic surface network but whose flow is unobserved. A complete map of our daily waters can give us an early warning for where droughts are born: the receding tips of the flowing network. Mapping them over years can give us a map of impermanence of our waters, showing where to expect water, and where not to. To that end, we feed the latest high-res sensor data to multiple deep learning models in order to map these flowing networks every day, stacking the times series maps over many years. Specifically, i) we enhance water segmentation to 50 cm/pixel resolution, a 60x improvement over previous state-of-the-art results. Our U-Net trained on 30-40cm WorldView3 images can detect streams as narrow as 1-3m (30-60x over SOTA). Our multi-sensor, multi-res variant, WasserNetz, fuses a multi-day window of 3m PlanetScope imagery with 1m LiDAR data, to detect streams 5-7m wide. Both U-Nets produce a water probability map at the pixel-level. ii) We integrate this water map over a DEM-derived synthetic valley network map, to produce a snapshot of flow at the stream level. iii) We apply this pipeline to a 2-year daily PlanetScope time-series of three watersheds in the US to produce the first high-fidelity dynamic map of stream flow frequency. The end result is a new map that, if applied at the national scale, could fundamentally improve how we manage our water resources around the world.</details></p></td>

Machine learning approaches are still in their infancy but already show the promise for democratizing weather predictions, by leveraging any data source and requiring less compute. In this work, we propose a methodology for data-driven and physics-aware global precipitation forecasting from satellite imagery.  To fully take advantage of the available data, we design the system as three elements: 1. The atmospheric state is estimated from recent satellite data.  2. The atmospheric state is propagated forward in time.  3. The atmospheric state is used to derive the precipitation intensity within a nearby time interval.

This can be attributed to the insufficient physics that is used as inputs to the deep learning models, inability of the models to perform high-quality spatio-temporal forecasts on physical fields, and the general challenges that exist due to the interacting scales of motion in turbulent flow.<details style="display:inline;"closed><summary>More</summary>While in practice, operational weather models have data assimilation to correct the trajectory of the forecasts every $6$ hours, the forward forecasting model, typically a high-resolution NWP makes the framework computationally expensive. In this paper, we show that a carefully chosen data assimilation scheme can be coupled to a deep learning based forecast model that allows the framework to maintain correct trajectories for several weeks. We ensure that the deep learning model is structurally equivariant (thus constraining key rotational features in the physics of the flow) and can perform skillful forecasts with only partial input (without the knowledge of the full physics or the equations of motions used in an NWP) while the data assimilation schemes incorporate noisy observations every $24$ hours. The framework shows skillful predictions for multiple weeks starting from a noisy initial condition without losing trajectory of the forecasts on the Z500 field of the ECMWF Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) dataset. We conclude that such hybrid deep learning and data assimilation frameworks can enable better forecast performance for data-driven weather prediction and can be extended to operational-quality multi-ensemble probabilistic weather forecasts at a fraction of current computational cost.</details></p></td>

Global estimates of aerosol mixing state indices have recently become available via supervised learning models, but require regionalization to ease spatiotemporal analysis. Here we developed a simple but effective unsupervised learning approach to regionalize predictions of global aerosol mixing state indices. We used the monthly average of aerosol mixing state indices global distribution as the input data. Grid cells were then clustered into regions by the k-means algorithm without explicit spatial information as input. This approach resulted in eleven regions over the globe with specific spatial aggregation patterns. Each region exhibited a unique distribution of mixing state indices and aerosol compositions, showing the effectiveness of the unsupervised regionalization approach.
