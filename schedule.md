 | 6:58 | 7:22 | Keynote | Yogesh Girdhar | [Curious Robots for Scientific Sampling](http://warp.whoi.edu/) |  <details open> <summary>Abstract</summary>WARPLab's research focuses on both the science and systems of exploration robots in extreme, communication starved environments such as the deep sea. It aims to develop robotics and machine learning-based techniques to enable search, discovery, and mapping of natural phenomena that are difficult to observe and study due to various physical and information-theoretic challenges.

WARPLab is headed by Yogesh Girdhar, and is part of the Deep Submergence Laboratory (DSL), and the Applied Ocean Physics & Engineering (AOPE) department at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</details> |
