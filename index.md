This workshop seeks to discuss work at the intersection of earth science and machine learning, bringing together scientists working on important geoscientific and planetary challenges together with machine learning specialists. This workshop encompasses both applied and theoretical work from both fields. 

Topics include demonstrating machine learning techniques in fields related to earth-systems science across 9 [sessions](https://ai4earthscience.github.io/neurips-2020-workshop/sessions), including, but not limited to: atmospheric science, water systems, geoscience, ecology, sensing, and human-earth interaction. The workshop will also feature a special track devoted to new earth-science datasets. 

Please see [Session Info](https://ai4earthscience.github.io/neurips-2020-workshop/sessions) for more detailed information and examples of applicable work.
