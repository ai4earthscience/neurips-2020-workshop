---
This workshop seeks to discuss work at the interesection of earth science and machine learning, bringing together scientists working on important geoscientific and planetary challenges together with machine learning specialists. This workshop encompasses both applied and theoretical work from both fields. 

We call for papers demonstrating machine learning techniques in fields related to earth-systems science, including, but not limited to: atmospheric science, ecology, sensing, geoscience, hydrology, and human-earth interaction. We especially welcome new models with physics-constrained or human-guided learning systems and new labeled datasets. Please see [Session Info](https://ai4earthscience.github.io/neurips-2020-workshop/sessions) for more detailed information and examples of applicable work.
