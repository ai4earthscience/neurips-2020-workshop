# Speaker Info

* Join our [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/ai4earth/shared_invite/zt-jkg0i982-VYRAd0HbjCG_6970Hcqfwg) to get the latest info and interact with other speakers/authors on the day of the workshop.  
* We have a [gather.town](https://neurips.gather.town/app/mSwJg1p1vbl7Vfxu/neurips-ai4earth) for session specific chats and casual conversations.   
* Each session will consist of serially streamed pre-recorded talks followed by one live Zoom Q&A with all of the speakers from the session. The session chair will post questions from the audience during the zoom session. Speakers are encouraged to also ask questions of fellow panelists and join in the discussion phase.   
* Before joining the zoom, it is imperative that you close the live stream and gather.town to avoid feedback.  
* There will be a ~1 min delay when switching between the livestream and Zoom for Q&A.     
* The zoom link was sent via email and can also be found at the top of the [neurips.cc](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2020/protected/workshop_16105.html) workshop page.   
* Although you may join any session's zoom discussion, you are only "required" to join your session's zoom Q&A.  We anticipate that slack/rocket.chat question will provide a more seamless experience for the audience.   
* The schedule is available [here](https://ai4earthscience.github.io/neurips-2020-workshop/schedule)    
* If you have any questions, reach out to your session moderator on slack or email.
