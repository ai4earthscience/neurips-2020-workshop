WARPLab's research focuses on both the science and systems of exploration robots in extreme, communication starved environments such as the deep sea. It aims to develop robotics and machine learning-based techniques to enable search, discovery, and mapping of natural phenomena that are difficult to observe and study due to various physical and information-theoretic challenges. 

WARPLab is headed by Yogesh Girdhar, and is part of the Deep Submergence Laboratory (DSL), and the Applied Ocean Physics & Engineering (AOPE) department at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</details>
